Bayes' Rule
===========

"Bayes’ rule is merely the mathematical relation between the prior allocation of credibility and the posterior reallocation of credibility conditional on data" (pp. 99--100).

Bayes' rule
-----------

> Thomas Bayes (1702-1761) was a mathematician and Presbyterian minister in England. His famous theorem was published posthumously in 1763, thanks to the extensive editorial efforts of his friend, Richard Price ([Bayes & Price, 1763](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/history/essay.pdf)). The simple rule has vast ramifications for statistical inference, and therefore as long as his name is attached to the rule, we’ll continue to see his name in textbooks. But Bayes himself probably was not fully aware of these ramifications, and many historians argue that it is Bayes’ successor, Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827), whose name should really label this type of analysis, because it was Laplace who independently rediscovered and extensively developed the methods (e.g., [Dale, 1999](https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Inverse_Probability.html?id=dGweIIXbAgMC); [McGrayne, 2011](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300188226/theory-would-not-die)). (p. 100)

I do recommend checking out McGrayne’s text. It’s an easy and entertaining read. For a sneak preview, why not [listen to her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oD6eBkjF9o) discuss the main themes in the book?

### Derived from definitions of conditional probability.

With equations 5.5 and 5.6, Kruschke gave us Bayes' rule in terms of *c* and *r*. Equation 5.5:

$$p(c|r) = \\frac{p(r|c)p(c)}{p(r)}$$

Since *p*(*r*)=∑<sub>*c*<sup>\*</sup></sub>*p*(*r*|*c*<sup>\*</sup>)*p*(*c*<sup>\*</sup>), we can re-express that as equation 5.6:

$$p(c|r) = \\frac{p(r|c)p(c)}{\\sum\_{c^\*}p(r|c^\*)p(c^\*)}$$

Applied to parameters and data
------------------------------

Here we get those equations re-expressed in the terms data analysts tend to think with, parameters (i.e., *θ*) and data (i.e., *D*).

$$p(\\theta|D) = \\frac{p(D|\\theta)p(\\theta)}{p(D)}$$

$$p(\\theta|D) = \\frac{p(D|\\theta)p(\\theta)}{\\sum\\limits\_{\\theta^\*}p(D|\\theta^\*)p(\\theta^\*)}$$

Complete examples: Estimating bias in a coin
--------------------------------------------

Behold Figure 5.1.a.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

tibble(theta = seq(from   = 0,   to = 1,  by = .1),
       prior = c(seq(from = 0,   to = .2, length.out = 6),
                 seq(from = .16, to = 0,  length.out = 5))) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, y = prior)) +
  geom_col(width = .025, color = "grey50", fill = "grey50") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .2)) +
  labs(title = "Prior",
       x = expression(theta),
       y = expression(paste("p(", theta, ")"))) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

If we follow Kruschke's equation 5.10 (i.e., the Bernoulli function) closely, we can express it as a function in R.

``` r
bernoulli <- function(theta, y){
  return(theta^y * (1 - theta)^(1 - y))
}
```

To get a sense of how it works, consider a single coin flip of heads when heads is considered a successful trial. We'll call the single sucessful trial `y = 1`. We can use our custom `bernoulli()` function to compute the likelihood of different values of *θ*. We'll look at 11 candedate *θ* values, which we'll call `theta_sequence`.

``` r
theta_sequence <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .1)

bernoulli(theta = theta_sequence, y = 1)
```

    ##  [1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0

Notice how our `theta_sequence` corresponds nicely with the sequence of *θ* values on the x-axes of Figure 5.1. We can combine `theta_sequence` and our `bernoulli()` function to make the middle panel of Figure 5.1

``` r
tibble(x = theta_sequence) %>%
  mutate(likelihood = bernoulli(theta = theta_sequence, y = 1)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = likelihood)) +
  geom_col(width = .025, color = "grey50", fill = "grey50") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .2)) +
  labs(title = "Likelihood",
       x = expression(theta),
       y = expression(paste("p(D|", theta, ")"))) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

![](05_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

In order to compute *p*(*D*) (i.e., the *evidence* or the *marginal likelihood*), we'll need to multiply our respective prior and likelihood values for each point in our theta sequence and then sum all that up. That sum will be our *marginal likelihood*.

``` r
tibble(theta = theta_sequence,
       prior = c(seq(from = 0,   to = .2, length.out = 6),
                 seq(from = .16, to = 0,  length.out = 5))) %>%
  mutate(likelihood = bernoulli(theta = theta_sequence, y = 1)) %>% 
  mutate(product    = prior * likelihood) %>% 
  summarise(marginal_likelihood = sum(product)) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   marginal_likelihood
    ##                 <dbl>
    ## 1                 0.5

Now we know our *p*(*D*)=0.5, we're ready to make Figure 5.1.c.

``` r
tibble(theta = theta_sequence,
       prior = c(seq(from = 0,   to = .2, length.out = 6),
                 seq(from = .16, to = 0,  length.out = 5))) %>%
  mutate(likelihood = bernoulli(theta = theta_sequence, y = 1)) %>% 
  mutate(posterior  = (prior * likelihood) / .5) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, y = posterior)) +
  geom_col(width = .025, color = "grey50", fill = "grey50") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .2)) +
  labs(title = "Posterior",
       x = expression(theta),
       y = expression(paste("p(", theta, "|D)"))) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

### Influence of sample size on the posterior.

In order to follow along with this section, we're going to have to update our Bernoulli likelihood function so it can accommodate more than a single trial. We'll anticipate chapter 6 and call our more general function the `Bernoulli_likelihood()`.

``` r
bernoulli_likelihood <- function(theta, data) {
  # `theta` = success probability parameter ranging from 0 to 1
  # `data` = the vector of data (i.e., a series of 0s and 1s)
  N   <- length(data)
  return(theta^sum(data) * (1 - theta)^(N - sum(data)))
  }
```

Here's the work required to make our version of the left portion of Figure 5.2.

``` r
small_data <- rep(0:1, times = c(3, 1))

tibble(theta =   seq(from = 0,     to = 1, by = .001),
       Prior = c(seq(from = 0,     to = 1, length.out = 501),
                 seq(from = 0.998, to = 0, length.out = 500))) %>% 
  mutate(Prior      = Prior / sum(Prior),
         Likelihood = bernoulli_likelihood(theta = theta,
                                           data  = small_data)) %>% 
  mutate(marginal_likelihood = sum(Prior * Likelihood)) %>% 
  mutate(Posterior           = (Prior * Likelihood) / marginal_likelihood) %>% 
  select(theta, Prior, Likelihood, Posterior) %>% 
  gather(key, value, -theta) %>% 
  mutate(key = factor(key, levels = c("Prior", "Likelihood", "Posterior"))) %>% 

  ggplot(aes(x = theta, ymin = 0, ymax = value)) +
  geom_ribbon(fill = "grey67") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .2)) +
  labs(x = expression(theta),
       y = "probability density") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~key, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1)
```

![](05_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

We’ll follow the same procedure to make the right portion of Figure 5.2. The only difference is how we switched from `small_data` to `large_data`.

``` r
large_data <- rep(0:1, times = c(30, 10))

tibble(theta =   seq(from = 0,     to = 1, by = .001),
       Prior = c(seq(from = 0,     to = 1, length.out = 501),
                 seq(from = 0.998, to = 0, length.out = 500))) %>% 
  mutate(Prior      = Prior / sum(Prior),
         Likelihood = bernoulli_likelihood(theta = theta,
                                           data  = large_data)) %>% 
  mutate(marginal_likelihood = sum(Prior * Likelihood)) %>% 
  mutate(Posterior           = (Prior * Likelihood) / marginal_likelihood) %>% 
  select(theta, Prior, Likelihood, Posterior) %>% 
  gather(key, value, -theta) %>% 
  mutate(key = factor(key, levels = c("Prior", "Likelihood", "Posterior"))) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, ymin = 0, ymax = value)) +
  geom_ribbon(fill = "grey67") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .2)) +
  labs(x = expression(theta),
       y = "probability density") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~key, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1)
```

![](05_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

With just an *N* = 40, the likelihood already dominated the posterior. But this is also a function of our fairly gentle prior.

### Influence of prior on the posterior.

It's not imediately obvious how Kruschke made his prior distributions for Figure 5.3. However, hidden away in his `BernGridExample.R` file he indicated that to get the distribution for the left side of Fiture 5.3, you simply raise the prior from the left of Figure 5.2 to the 0.1 power.

``` r
small_data <- rep(0:1, times = c(3, 1))

tibble(theta =   seq(from = 0,     to = 1, by = .001),
       Prior = c(seq(from = 0,     to = 1, length.out = 501),
                 seq(from = 0.998, to = 0, length.out = 500))) %>% 
  # here's the important line of code
  mutate(Prior = Prior^0.1) %>% 
  mutate(Prior = Prior / sum(Prior),
         Likelihood = bernoulli_likelihood(theta = theta,
                                           data  = small_data)) %>% 
  mutate(marginal_likelihood = sum(Prior * Likelihood)) %>% 
  mutate(Posterior           = (Prior * Likelihood) / marginal_likelihood) %>% 
  select(theta, Prior, Likelihood, Posterior) %>% 
  gather(key, value, -theta) %>% 
  mutate(key = factor(key, levels = c("Prior", "Likelihood", "Posterior"))) %>% 

  ggplot(aes(x = theta, ymin = 0, ymax = value)) +
  geom_ribbon(fill = "grey67") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .2)) +
  labs(x = expression(theta),
       y = "probability density") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~key, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1)
```

![](05_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

The trick is similar for the right half of Figure 5.3.

``` r
large_data <- rep(0:1, times = c(30, 10))

tibble(theta =   seq(from = 0,     to = 1, by = .001),
       Prior = c(seq(from = 0,     to = 1, length.out = 501),
                 seq(from = 0.998, to = 0, length.out = 500))) %>% 
  mutate(Prior      = Prior / sum(Prior),
         Likelihood = bernoulli_likelihood(theta = theta,
                                           data  = large_data)) %>% 
  # here's the important line of code
  mutate(Prior               = Prior^10) %>% 
  mutate(marginal_likelihood = sum(Prior * Likelihood)) %>% 
  mutate(Posterior           = (Prior * Likelihood) / marginal_likelihood) %>% 
  select(theta, Prior, Likelihood, Posterior) %>% 
  gather(key, value, -theta) %>% 
  mutate(key = factor(key, levels = c("Prior", "Likelihood", "Posterior"))) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, ymin = 0, ymax = value)) +
  geom_ribbon(fill = "grey67") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .2)) +
  labs(x = expression(theta),
       y = "probability density") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~key, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1)
```

5.4. Why Bayesian inference can be difficult
--------------------------------------------

> Determining the posterior distribution directly from Bayes’ rule involves computing the evidence (a.k.a. marginal likelihood) in Equations 5.8 and 5.9. In the usual case of continuous parameters, the integral in Equation 5.9 can be impossible to solve analytically. Historically, the difficulty of the integration was addressed by restricting models to relatively simple likelihood functions with corresponding formulas for prior distributions, called *conjugate* priors, that "played nice" with the likelihood function to produce a tractable integral. (p. 115, *emphasis* in the original)

However, the simple model + conjugate prior approach has its limitations. As we’ll see, we often want to fit complex models without shackling ourselves with conjugate priors—which can be quite a pain to work with. Happily,

> another kind of approximation involves randomly sampling a large number of representative combinations of parameter values from the posterior distribution. In recent decades, many such algorithms have been developed, generally referred to as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. What makes these methods so useful is that they can generate representative parameter-value combinations from the posterior distribution of complex models *without* computing the integral in Bayes’ rule. It is the development of these MCMC methods that has allowed Bayesian statistical methods to gain practical use. (pp. 115--116, *emphasis* in the original)
