Goals, Power, and Sample Size
=============================

> Researchers collect data in order to achieve a goal. Sometimes the goal is to show that a suspected underlying state of the world is credible; other times the goal is to achieve a minimal degree of precision on whatever trends are observed. Whatever the goal, it can only be probabilistically achieved, as opposed to definitely achieved, because data are replete with random noise that can obscure the underlying state of the world. Statistical power is the probability of achieving the goal of a planned empirical study, if a suspected underlying state of the world is true. (p. 359)

13.1. The will to power
-----------------------

"In this section, \[Kruschke laid out a\] framework for research and data analysis \[that led\] to a more precise definition of power and how to compute it" (p. 360).

### 13.1.1 Goals and obstacles.

The three research goals Kruschke dealt with in this chapter were:

-   to reject a null value for a parameter
-   to confirm the legitimacy of a particular parameter value
-   to estimate a parameter with reasonable precision

All these could, of course, be extended to contexts involving multiple parameters. And all of these were dealt with respect to 95% HDIs.

### 13.1.2 Power

> Because of random noise, the goal of a study can be achieved only probabilistically. The probability of achieving the goal, given the hypothetical state of the world and the sampling plan, is called the *power* of the planned research. In traditional null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), power has only one goal (rejecting the null hypothesis), and there is one conventional sampling plan (stop at predetermined sample size) and the hypothesis is only a single specific value of the parameter. In traditional statistics, that is *the* definition of power. That definition is generalized in this book to include other goals, other sampling plans, and hypotheses that involve an entire distribution on parameters. (p. 360, *emphasis* in the original)

Three primary methods to increase power are:

-   reducing measurement error
-   increasing the effect size
-   increasing the sample size

Kruschke then laid out a five-step procedure to compute power within a Bayesian workflow.

1.  Use theory/prior information to specify hypothetical distributions for all parameter values in the model.
2.  Use those distributions to generate synthetic data according to the planned sampling method.
3.  Fit the proposed model—including the relevant priors--with the synthetic data.
4.  Use the posterior to determine whether we attained the research goal.
5.  Repeat the procedure many times (i.e., using different `set.seed()` values) to get a distribution of results.

### 13.1.3 Sample size.

> *The best that a large sample can do is exactly reflect the data-generating distribution.* If the data-generating distribution has considerable mass straddling the null value, then the best we can do is get estimates that include and straddle the null value. As a simple example, suppose that we think that a coin may be biased, and the data-generating hypothesis entertains four possible values of *θ* , with p(*θ* = 0.5)=25%, p(*θ* = 0.6)=25%, p(*θ* = 0.7)=25%, and p(*θ* = 0.8)=25%. Because 25% of the simulated data come from a fair coin, the maximum probability of excluding *θ* = 0.5, even with a huge sample, is 75%.
>
> Therefore, when planning the sample size for an experiment, it is crucial to decide what a realistic goal is. If there are good reasons to posit a highly certain data-generating hypothesis, perhaps because of extensive previous results, then a viable goal may be to exclude a null value. On the other hand, if the data-generating hypothesis is somewhat vague, then a more reasonable goal is to attain a desired degree of precision in the posterior. (p. 364, *emphasis* in the original)

### 13.1.4 Other expressions of goals.

I'm going to skip over these.

> In the remainder of the chapter, it will be assumed that the goal of the research is estimation of the parameter values, starting with a viable prior. The resulting posterior distribution is then used to assess whether the goal was achieved. (p. 366)

13.2. Computing power and sample size
-------------------------------------

> As our first worked-out example, consider the simplest case: Data from a single coin. Perhaps we are polling a population and we want to precisely estimate the preferences for candidates A or B. Perhaps we want to know if a drug has more than a 50% cure rate. (p. 366)

### 13.2.1 When the goal is to exclude a null value.

> Usually it is more intuitively accessible to get prior data, or to think of idealized prior data, than to directly specify a distribution over parameter values. For example, based on knowledge about the application domain, we might have 2000 actual or idealized flips of the coin for which the result showed 65% heads. Therefore we’ll describe the data-generating hypothesis as a beta distribution with a mode of 0.65 and concentration based on 2000 flips after a uniform "proto-prior": beta(*θ*|0.65 ⋅ (2000 − 2)+1, (1 − 0.65)⋅(2000 − 2)+1).

We might express that in code like this.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

kappa <- 2000
omega <- .65

tibble(theta = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .001)) %>% 
  mutate(prior = dbeta(theta,
                       shape1 =      omega  * (kappa - 2) + 1,
                       shape2 = (1 - omega) * (kappa - 2) + 1)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, ymin = 0, ymax = prior)) +
  geom_ribbon(size = 0, fill = "grey67") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  labs(title = "Behold our prior. It's rather peaked.",
       x = NULL) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

![](13_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)

If we wanted to take some random draws from that prior, say 5, we'd do something like this.

``` r
n <- 5

set.seed(13)
rbeta(n,
      shape1 =      omega  * (kappa - 2) + 1,
      shape2 = (1 - omega) * (kappa - 2) + 1)
```

    ## [1] 0.6430548 0.6532279 0.6250891 0.6475884 0.6351476

Now let's just take one draw and call it `bias`.

``` r
n <- 1

set.seed(13)
bias <-
  rbeta(n,
        shape1 =      omega  * (kappa - 2) + 1,
        shape2 = (1 - omega) * (kappa - 2) + 1)

print(bias)
```

    ## [1] 0.6430548

Now we

> simulate flipping a coin with that bias *N* times. The simulated data have *z* heads and *N* − *z* tails. The proportion of heads, *z*/*N*, will tend to be around \[0.643\], but will be higher or lower because of randomness in the flips. (p. 367)

``` r
# pick some large number
n <- 1e3

set.seed(13)
tibble(flips  = rbernoulli(n = n, p = bias)) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            z = sum(flips)) %>% 
  mutate(`proportion of heads` = z / n)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##       n     z `proportion of heads`
    ##   <int> <int>                 <dbl>
    ## 1  1000   652                 0.652

We'll walk through the rest of the steps in the next section.

### 13.2.2 Formal solution and implementation in R.

I've been playing around with this a bit. If you look closely at the code block on page 369, you'll see that Kruschke's `minNforHDIpower()` function requires the `HDIofICDF()` function from his `DBDA2E-utilities.R` file, which we usually recast as `hdi_of_icdf()`.

``` r
hdi_of_icdf <- function(name, width = .95, tol = 1e-8, ... ) {
  incredible_mass <-  1.0 - width
  interval_width  <- function(low_tail_prob, name, width, ...) {
    name(width + low_tail_prob, ...) - name(low_tail_prob, ...)
  }
  opt_info <- optimize(interval_width, c(0, incredible_mass), 
                       name = name, width = width, 
                       tol = tol, ...)
  hdi_lower_tail_prob <- opt_info$minimum
  return(c(name(hdi_lower_tail_prob, ...),
           name(width + hdi_lower_tail_prob, ...)))
}
```

Just to warm up, consider a Beta distribution for which *ω* = .5 and *κ* = 2000. Here are the 95% HDIs.

``` r
omega <- .5

hdi_of_icdf(name   = qbeta,
            shape1 =      omega  * (kappa - 2) + 1,
            shape2 = (1 - omega) * (kappa - 2) + 1)
```

    ## [1] 0.4780947 0.5219053

Those look a whole lot like the ROPE values Kruschke specified in his example at the bottom of page 370. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Now that we have our `hdi_of_icdf()` function, we’re ready to define our version of `minNforHDIpower()`, which I’m calling `min_n_for_hdi_power()`.

``` r
min_n_for_hdi_power <- 
  function(gen_prior_mode, gen_prior_n,
           hdi_max_width = NULL, null_value = NULL,
           rope = c(max(0, null_value - 0.02), min(1, null_value + 0.02)),
           desired_power = 0.8, aud_prior_mode = 0.5, aud_prior_n = 2,
           hdi_mass = 0.95, init_samp_size = 20, verbose = TRUE) {
  # Check for argument consistency:
  if (!xor(is.null(hdi_max_width), is.null(null_value))) {
    stop("One and only one of `hdi_max_width` and `null_value` must be specified.")
  }
  # Convert prior mode and N to a, b parameters of beta distribution:
  gen_prior_a <-        gen_prior_mode  * (gen_prior_n - 2) + 1
  gen_prior_b <- (1.0 - gen_prior_mode) * (gen_prior_n - 2) + 1
  aud_prior_a <-        aud_prior_mode  * (aud_prior_n - 2) + 1
  aud_prior_b <- (1.0 - aud_prior_mode) * (aud_prior_n - 2) + 1
  # Initialize loop for incrementing `sample_size`:
  sample_size <- init_samp_size
  not_powerful_enough = TRUE
  # Increment `sample_size` until desired power is achieved:
  while(not_powerful_enough) {
    z_vec <- 0:sample_size # vector of all possible z values for N flips.
    # Compute probability of each z value for data-generating prior:
    p_z_vec <- exp(lchoose(sample_size, z_vec)
                 + lbeta(z_vec + gen_prior_a, sample_size - z_vec + gen_prior_b)
                 - lbeta(gen_prior_a, gen_prior_b))
    # For each z value, compute posterior HDI:
    # `hdi_matrix` will hold HDI limits for each z:
    hdi_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = length(z_vec), ncol = 2)
    for (z_id_x in 1:length(z_vec)) {
      z <- z_vec[z_id_x]
      hdi_matrix[z_id_x, ] <- hdi_of_icdf(qbeta,
                                          shape1 = z + aud_prior_a,
                                          shape2 = sample_size - z + aud_prior_b,
                                          width  = hdi_mass)
}
# Compute HDI widths:
hdi_width <- hdi_matrix[, 2] - hdi_matrix[, 1]
# Sum the probabilities of outcomes with satisfactory HDI widths:
if (!is.null(hdi_max_width)) {
  power_hdi <- sum(p_z_vec[hdi_width < hdi_max_width])
}
# Sum the probabilities of outcomes with HDI excluding `rope`:
if (!is.null(null_value)) {
  power_hdi <- sum(p_z_vec[hdi_matrix[, 1] > rope[2] | hdi_matrix[, 2] < rope[1]])
}
if (verbose) {
  cat(" For sample size = ", sample_size, ", power = ", power_hdi,
       "\n", sep = ""); flush.console() 
  }
if (power_hdi > desired_power) {  # If desired power is attained,
  not_powerful_enough = FALSE
} else {
  sample_size <- sample_size + 1
# set flag to stop,
# otherwise
# increment the sample size.
    }
  } # End while( not_powerful_enough ).
  # Return the sample size that achieved the desired power:
  return(sample_size)
}
```

Other than altering Kruschke's formatting a little bit, the only meaningful change I made to the code was removing the line that checked for the `HDIofICD()` function and then `source()`ed it, if necessary. Following along with Kruschke on page 370, here's an example for which *ω*<sub>data generating</sub> = .75, *k**a**p**p**a* = 2000, the ROPE is \[.48, .52\], and the desired power is the conventional .8.

``` r
min_n_for_hdi_power(gen_prior_mode = .75, 
                    gen_prior_n    = 2000,
                    hdi_max_width  = NULL, 
                    null_value     = .5, 
                    rope           = c(.48, .52),
                    desired_power  = .8,
                    aud_prior_mode = .5, 
                    aud_prior_n    = 2,
                    hdi_mass       = .95, 
                    init_samp_size = 20, 
                    verbose        = TRUE)
```

    ##  For sample size = 20, power = 0.6159196
    ##  For sample size = 21, power = 0.5655352
    ##  For sample size = 22, power = 0.6976802
    ##  For sample size = 23, power = 0.6521637
    ##  For sample size = 24, power = 0.606033
    ##  For sample size = 25, power = 0.7245362
    ##  For sample size = 26, power = 0.6832871
    ##  For sample size = 27, power = 0.7836981
    ##  For sample size = 28, power = 0.7479021
    ##  For sample size = 29, power = 0.7103786
    ##  For sample size = 30, power = 0.8009259

    ## [1] 30

Just like in the text, the necessary *N* = 30.

Unlike in the text, I increased the value of `init_samp_size` from 5 to 20 to keep the output a reasonable length. To clarify what we just did,

> in that function call, the data-generating distribution has a mode of 0.75 and concentration of 2000, which means that the hypothesized world is pretty certain that coins have a bias of 0.75. The goal is to exclude a null value of 0.5 with a ROPE from 0.48 to 0.52. The desired power \[is\] 80%. The audience prior is uniform. When the function is executed, it displays the power for increasing values of sample size, until stopping at *N* = 30. (p. 370)

If it's unclear why the "audience prior is uniform", consider this.

``` r
kappa <- 2
omega <- .5

tibble(theta = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .01)) %>% 
  mutate(prior = dbeta(theta,
                       shape1 =      omega  * (kappa - 2) + 1,
                       shape2 = (1 - omega) * (kappa - 2) + 1)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, ymin = 0, ymax = prior)) +
  geom_ribbon(size = 0, fill = "grey67") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1.25)) +
  labs(title = "Behold the uniform audience prior.",
       x = NULL) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

![](13_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

If you work out the algebra with `omega` and `kappa`, you’ll see this is a Beta(1, 1). Thus, `aud_prior_n` is *κ* and `aud_prior_mode` is *ω*.

Here we'll wrap our `min_n_for_hdi_power()` function into a simple `sim_power()` function for use with `purrr::map2()`.

``` r
sim_power <- function(mode, power) {
  min_n_for_hdi_power(gen_prior_mode = mode, 
                      gen_prior_n    = 2000,
                      hdi_max_width  = NULL, 
                      null_value     = .5, 
                      rope           = c(.48, .52),
                      desired_power  = power,
                      aud_prior_mode = .5, 
                      aud_prior_n    = 2,
                      hdi_mass       = .95, 
                      init_samp_size = 1, 
                      verbose        = TRUE)
}
```

Here we use the two functions to compute the values in Table 13.1 on page 367.

``` r
sim <-
  tibble(mode = seq(from = .6, to = .85, by = .05)) %>% 
  expand(mode, power = c(.7, .8, .9)) %>% 
  mutate(results = purrr::map2(mode, power, sim_power)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

The results look like this.

``` r
print(sim)
```

    ## # A tibble: 18 x 3
    ##     mode power results
    ##    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1  0.6    0.7     238
    ##  2  0.6    0.8     309
    ##  3  0.6    0.9     430
    ##  4  0.65   0.7      83
    ##  5  0.65   0.8     109
    ##  6  0.65   0.9     150
    ##  7  0.7    0.7      40
    ##  8  0.7    0.8      52
    ##  9  0.7    0.9      74
    ## 10  0.75   0.7      25
    ## 11  0.75   0.8      30
    ## 12  0.75   0.9      43
    ## 13  0.8    0.7      16
    ## 14  0.8    0.8      19
    ## 15  0.8    0.9      27
    ## 16  0.85   0.7       7
    ## 17  0.85   0.8      14
    ## 18  0.85   0.9      16

It takes just a tiny bit of wrangling to reproduce Table 13.1.

``` r
sim %>%
  spread(key = mode, value = results) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

|  power|  0.6|  0.65|  0.7|  0.75|  0.8|  0.85|
|------:|----:|-----:|----:|-----:|----:|-----:|
|    0.7|  238|    83|   40|    25|   16|     7|
|    0.8|  309|   109|   52|    30|   19|    14|
|    0.9|  430|   150|   74|    43|   27|    16|

### 13.2.3 When the goal is precision.

Recall that if we have Beta(*θ*, *a*, *b*) prior for *θ* of the Bernoulli likelihood function, then the analytic solution for the posterior is Beta(*θ*|*z* + *a*, *N*–*z* + *b*). In our first example, *z* = 6 out of *N* = 10 randomly selected voters preferred candidate A and we started with a flat Beta(*θ*, 1, 1) prior. We can check that our posterior is indeed Beta(7, 5) by working through the algebra.

``` r
z <- 6
n <- 10

# posterior alpha
z + 1
```

    ## [1] 7

``` r
# posterior beta
n - z + 1
```

    ## [1] 5

Here's how we compute the 95% HDIs.

``` r
(h <-
  hdi_of_icdf(name   = qbeta,
              shape1 = 7,
              shape2 = 5)
)
```

    ## [1] 0.3182322 0.8414276

The beta(7, 5) distribution looks like this.

``` r
tibble(theta = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .01)) %>% 
  mutate(density = dbeta(theta,
                         shape1 = 7,
                         shape2 = 5)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, ymin = 0, ymax = density)) +
  geom_ribbon(size = 0, fill = "grey67") +
  geom_segment(x = h[1], xend = h[2],
               y = 0,    yend = 0,
               size = 1) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = .6, y = 1/3, label = "95% HDI") +
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = c(0, h[1], z / n, h[2], 1) %>% round(2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  ggtitle("Beta (7, 5)") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

![](13_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)

"It turns out, in this case, that we can never have a sample size large enough to achieve the goal of 80% of the HDIs falling above *θ* = 0.5. To see why," keep reading in the text (p. 371). Happily,

> there is a more useful goal, however. Instead of trying to reject a particular value of *θ*, we set as our goal a desired degree of precision in the posterior estimate. For example, our goal might be that the 95% HDI has width less than 0.2, at least 80% of the time. (p. 371)

If you look back up at our `min_n_for_hdi_power()` defining code, above, you'll see that "One and only one of `hdi_max_width` and `null_value` must be specified." So if we want to determine the necessary *N* for an 95% HDI width of less than .2, we need to set `hdi_max_width = .2` and `null_value = NULL`.

``` r
min_n_for_hdi_power(gen_prior_mode = .75, 
                    gen_prior_n    = 10,
                    hdi_max_width  = .2,  # look here
                    null_value     = NULL, 
                    rope           = NULL,
                    desired_power  = .8,
                    aud_prior_mode = .5,

Just like in the last section, here I set `init_samp_size` to a higher value than in the text in order to keep the output reasonably short. To reproduce the results in Table 13.2, we’ll need to adjust the `min_n_for_hdi_power()` parameters within our `sim_power()` function.

``` r
sim_power <- function(mode, power) {
  min_n_for_hdi_power(gen_prior_mode = mode, 
                      gen_prior_n    = 10,
                      hdi_max_width  = .2, 
                      null_value     = NULL, 
                      rope           = NULL,
                      desired_power  = power,
                      aud_prior_mode = .5, 
                      aud_prior_n    = 2,
                      hdi_mass       = .95, 
                      init_samp_size = 50, 
                      verbose        = TRUE)
}

sim <-
  tibble(mode = seq(from = .6, to = .85, by = .05)) %>% 
  expand(mode, power = c(.7, .8, .9)) %>% 
  mutate(results = purrr::map2(mode, power, sim_power)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

Let's make that table.

``` r
sim %>%
  spread(key = mode, value = results) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

|  power|  0.6|  0.65|  0.7|  0.75|  0.8|  0.85|
|------:|----:|-----:|----:|-----:|----:|-----:|

|    0.9|   93|    93|   93|    92|   91|    89|

What did that audience prior look like?

``` r
kappa <- 2
omega <- .5

tibble(theta = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .1)) %>% 
  mutate(density = dbeta(theta,
                         shape1 =      omega  * (kappa - 2) + 1,
                         shape2 = (1 - omega) * (kappa - 2) + 1)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, ymin = 0, ymax = density)) +
  geom_ribbon(size = 0, fill = "grey67") +

Here are what the Beta distributions based on the `sim` look like.

``` r

  rename(n = results) %>% 
  expand(nesting(mode, power, n), theta = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .01)) %>% 
  mutate(density = dbeta(theta,
                         shape1 =      mode  * (n - 2) + 1,
                         shape2 = (1 - mode) * (n - 2) + 1)) %>%

```

Toward the end of the section, Kruschke mentioned the required sample size shoots up if our desired HDI width is 0.1. Here's the simulation.

``` r
sim_power <- function(mode, power) {
    min_n_for_hdi_power(gen_prior_mode = mode, 
                        gen_prior_n    = 10,
                        hdi_max_width  = .1, 
                        null_value     = NULL, 
                        rope           = NULL,
                        desired_power  = power,
                        aud_prior_mode = .5, 
                        aud_prior_n    = 2,
                        hdi_mass       = .95, 
                        init_samp_size = 300,  # save some time and up this parameter 
                        verbose        = TRUE)
}

sim <-
  tibble(mode = seq(from = .6, to = .85, by = .05)) %>% 
  expand(mode, power = c(.7, .8, .9)) %>% 
  mutate(results = purrr::map2(mode, power, sim_power)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

Display the results in a table like before.

``` r
sim %>%

### 13.2.4 Monte Carlo approximation of power.

> The previous sections illustrated the ideas of power and sample size for a simple case in which the power could be computed by mathematical derivation. \[If your field is like mine, this will not be the norm for your research projects.\] In this section, we approximate the power by Monte Carlo simulation. The R script for this simple case serves as a template for more realistic applications. The R script is named `Jags-Ydich-Xnom1subj-MbernBeta-Power.R`, which is the name for the JAGS program for dichotomous data from a single "subject" suffixed with the word "Power." As you read through the script, presented below, remember that you can find information about any general R command by using the help function in R, as explained in Section 3.3.1 (p. 39). (p. 372)

The code in Kruschke’s `Jags-Ydich-Xnom1subj-MbernBeta-Power.R` file also makes use of the content in his `Jags-Ydich-Xnom1subj-MbernBeta.R` file. As is often the case, the code in both is JAGS and base R centric. We'll be taking a different approach. I’ll walk you through. First, let’s fire up brms.

``` r
library(brms)
```

This won’t be of much concern for some of the complex models we’ll be fitting in later chapters. But for simple models like this, a lot of the time you spend waiting for `brms::brm()` to return your posterior and its summary has to do with compilation time. The issue of compilation goes into technical details I just don’t have the will to go through. But if we can avoid or minimize compilation time, it’ll be a big boon for our power simulations. As it turns out, we can. The first time we fit our desired model, we have to compile. Once we have that initial fit in hand, we can reuse it with the `update()` function. So that’s what we’re going to do, here. We’re going to fit the model once and save it.

``` r
# how many rows of 0s and 1s should we have in the data?
n     <- 74

# should the values in the data be of single draws (i.e., 1), or summaries?
size  <- 1

# what is the population mode for theta we'd like to base this all on?
omega <- .7

# fit that joint
fit <-
  brm(data = tibble(y = rbinom(n, size, omega)),
      family = bernoulli(link = identity),
      y ~ 1,
      prior(beta(1, 1), class = Intercept),
      warmup = 1000, iter = 3000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 13,
      control = list(adapt_delta = .9))
```

Our practice, here, will be to keep all the specifications in `fit` constant across the simulations. So choose them wisely. If you look deep into the bowels of the `Jags-Ydich-Xnom1subj-MbernBeta.R` file, you'll see Kruschke used the flat Beta(1, 1) prior, which is where our `prior(beta(1, 1), class = Intercept)` code came from. This is the audience prior. We aren’t particularly concerned about the data we simulated with the `data = tibble(y = rbinom(n, size, omega))` line. The main thing is that they follow the same basic structure our subsequent data will.

To make sure we're not setting ourselves up to fail, we might make sure the chains look okay.

``` r
plot(fit)
```

![](13_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)

Looks like a dream. Let's move forward and run the simulation proper. In his script file, Kruschke suggested we simulate with large *N*s like 1000 or so. Since this is just an example, I’m gonna cut that to 100.

``` r
# how many simulations would you like?
n_sim <- 100

# specify omega and kappa of the hypothetical parameter distribution
omega <- .7
kappa <- 2000

# make it reproducible
set.seed(13)

fits1 <-
  # define some of the parameters
  tibble(n     = n,
         size  = size,
         theta = rbeta(n_sim, 
                       shape1 =      omega  * (kappa - 2) + 1,
                       shape2 = (1 - omega) * (kappa - 2) + 1)) %>% 
  # simulate the data
  mutate(data = pmap(list(n, size, theta), rbinom)) %>% 
  # fit the models on the simulated data
  mutate(fit  = map(data, ~update(fit, newdata = list(y = .))))
```

*What have we done?*, you might ask.

``` r
head(fits1)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 5
    ##       n  size theta data       fit          
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <list>     <list>       
    ## 1    74     1 0.693 <int [74]> <S3: brmsfit>
    ## 2    74     1 0.703 <int [74]> <S3: brmsfit>
    ## 3    74     1 0.676 <int [74]> <S3: brmsfit>
    ## 4    74     1 0.698 <int [74]> <S3: brmsfit>
    ## 5    74     1 0.686 <int [74]> <S3: brmsfit>
    ## 6    74     1 0.695 <int [74]> <S3: brmsfit>

The `theta` column contains the draws from the hypothesized parameter distribution, which we’ve indicated is hovering tightly around .7. The `data` column is nested in that within each row, we’ve saved an entire *N* = 74 row tibble. Most importantly, the `fit` column contains the brmsfit objects for each of our 100 simulations. See that last `mutate()` line, above? That’s where those came from. Within `purrr::map()`, we fed our simulated data sets, one row at a time, into the `update()` function via the `newdata` argument. Because we used `update()` based on our initial `fit`, we avoided subsequent compilation times and just samples like a boss.

Before we move on, I should give some credit. The foundations of this workflow come from Wickham’s talk [*Managing many models with R*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=426&v=rz3_FDVt9eg). I also got some additional [help on twitter](https://twitter.com/PStrafo/status/1107447953709383681) from [Phil Straforelli](https://twitter.com/PStrafo).

We still have some work to do. Next, we'll want to make a custom function that will make it easy to compute the intercept HDIs for each of our fits.

``` r
get_hdi <- function(fit){
  fit %>% 
    posterior_samples() %>% 
    tidybayes::mode_hdi(b_Intercept) %>% 
    select(.lower:.upper)
}

# how does it work?
get_hdi(fit)
```

    ##      .lower    .upper
    ## 1 0.6218496 0.8236595

Now we’ll apply that function to our `fits` tibble to pull those simulated HDIs. Then we’ll program in the markers for the ROPE and HDI width criteria, perform logical tests to see whether they were passes within each of the 100 simulations, and summarize the tests.

``` r
fits1 %>% 
  # get those HDIs and `unnest()`
  mutate(hdi = map(fit, get_hdi)) %>% 
  unnest(hdi) %>% 
  # define our test criteria
  mutate(rope_ll   = .48,
         rope_ul   = .52,
         hdi_width = .2) %>% 
  # perform the tests
  mutate(pass_rope  = .lower > rope_ul | .upper < rope_ll,
         pass_width = (.upper - .lower) < hdi_width) %>% 
  # summarize those joints
  summarise(power_rope  = mean(pass_rope),
            power_width = mean(pass_width))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##   power_rope power_width
    ##        <dbl>       <dbl>
    ## 1       0.91        0.36

Those are our power estimates. To compute their HDIS, just increase them by a factor of 100 and plug them into the formulas within the shape arguments in `hdi_of_icdf()`.

``` r
# HDIs for the ROPE power estimate
hdi_of_icdf(name   = qbeta,
            shape1 = 1 + 91,
            shape2 = 1 + n_sim - 91) %>% 
  round(digits = 2)
```

    ## [1] 0.84 0.96

``` r
# HDIs for the width power estimate
hdi_of_icdf(name   = qbeta,
            shape1 = 1 + 36,
            shape2 = 1 + n_sim - 36) %>% 
  round(digits = 2)
```

    ## [1] 0.27 0.46

Following the middle of page 375, here's the whole thing again, but with *κ* = 10 and *N* = 91.

``` r
# how many rows of 0s and 1s should we have in the data?
n     <- 91

# how many simulations would you like?
n_sim <- 100

# specify omega and kappa of the hypothetical parameter distribution
omega <- .7
kappa <- 10

# make it reproducible
set.seed(13)

# simulate
fits2 <-
  tibble(n     = n,
         size  = size,
         theta = rbeta(n_sim, 
                       shape1 =      omega  * (kappa - 2) + 1,
                       shape2 = (1 - omega) * (kappa - 2) + 1)) %>% 
  mutate(data = pmap(list(n, size, theta), rbinom)) %>% 
  mutate(fit  = map(data, ~update(fit, newdata = list(y = .))))
```

Summarize the results.

``` r
fits2 %>% 
  mutate(hdi = map(fit, get_hdi)) %>% 
  unnest(hdi) %>% 
  mutate(rope_ll   = .48,
         rope_ul   = .52,
         hdi_width = .2) %>% 
  mutate(pass_rope  = .lower > rope_ul | .upper < rope_ll,
         pass_width = (.upper - .lower) < hdi_width) %>% 
  summarise(power_rope  = mean(pass_rope),
            power_width = mean(pass_width))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2

    ##        <dbl>       <dbl>
    ## 1       0.71        0.87

Compute the corresponding HDIs.

``` r
# HDIs for the ROPE power estimate
hdi_of_icdf(name   = qbeta,
            shape1 = 1 + 71,
            shape2 = 1 + n_sim - 71) %>%
